PLATFORM TESTING
================

AspectJ Compiler
----------------
This distribution is normally tested on the AspectJ compiler release prior
to the current release (compiler and IDE development are concurrent).
When changes to the compiler may affect AspectJ mode, testing is also done
on a pre-release of the current compiler release.

Emacs
-----
This distribution was tested under GNU Emacs 20.7 (ntemacs),
XEmacs 21.4.3 (NT).  GNU Emacs has also been used on Emacs 20.3.1
on Solaris and 20.7 on Linux; XEmacs 21.1.4 on Linux.  Positive reports
have been heard on GNU Emacs 21 alpha.  Other combinations have not
been tested.  Please let us know if you try others.

Operating System
----------------
AspectJ mode is tested on Windows 2000, and has been observed to work
under Windows NT 4.0, Solaris, and Linux.  Please let us know if you
try any additional platforms.
